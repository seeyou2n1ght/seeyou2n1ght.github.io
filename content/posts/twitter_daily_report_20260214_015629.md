- [VIP] @unknown: GPT-5.2 derived a new result in theoretical physics.  We’re releasing the result in a preprint with researchers from @the_IAS, @VanderbiltU, @Cambridge_Uni, and @Harvard. It shows that a gluon interaction many physicists expected would not occur can arise under specific conditions.  https://t.co/EAZhKWacsG (❤️4514 🔁609) [Link](https://x.com/unknown/status/2022390096625078389)
- [VIP] @unknown: In modern amplitude theory, simple formulas often signal deeper structure.   Showing that a case long thought to be empty actually contains structure sharpens our understanding of the mathematics of the strong force and opens new directions, including extensions to gravity and related amplitude relations.   Some of these generalizations are also amenable to solution via this new AI methodology and will be reported on elsewhere. (❤️342 🔁13) [Link](https://x.com/unknown/status/2022390103017161216)
